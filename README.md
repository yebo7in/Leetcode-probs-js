#Leetcode Problems

##sortArray
I used quick sort at first but got a TLE,so I switched to merge sort which passed all test cases.
1. quick sort has an average TC for nlogn, but in a worst case, it's n^2.
2. merge sort has both average and worst case TC for nlogn.

##Network Delay time
This question is simple once we understand how Dijkstra's Algorithem works.
1. TC: O((V+E)logV).
2. SC: O(V+E)
